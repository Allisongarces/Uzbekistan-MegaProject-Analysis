AJEM-17-02-03.docx,"Risk, Resilience, and Crisis Management","The Prevention, Preparedness, Response, Recovery (PPRR) framework has been a cornerstone of emergency management policy in Australia, adapted from the U.S. model of Comprehensive Emergency Management. However, recent analyses and critiques, such as those by Mal Crondstedt and others, challenge the continued relevance of PPRR in modern risk management.

Critics argue that PPRR is outdated due to its rigid categorization of emergency phases, which may constrain innovative risk treatment strategies. Key issues include:

Artificial separation of the four elements, leading to inefficiencies in planning and debate over categorization rather than outcomes.
Equal emphasis on all four phases, which may not align with risk-based needs.
A linear, sequential approach that does not reflect the complex, non-linear nature of disasters.
Bias towards physical actions, overlooking socio-economic and psychological vulnerabilities.
In response, experts advocate for a risk management methodology that emphasizes criteria such as efficiency, effectiveness, and resource economy. This approach aligns with international standards like AS/NZS4360:1995, which prioritize risk treatments based on impact and cost-benefit analysis rather than adherence to fixed categories.

Recent developments in emergency management policy emphasize a shift from internal agency focus to community-centered, business-like risk management. This includes better resource allocation, performance-based outcomes, and integration of social and economic vulnerabilities into planning. The Australian Emergency Management Guidelines now reflect these shifts, incorporating broader risk treatment options and community engagement.

While PPRR still serves as a reference model in emergency management plans, experts recommend its reconsideration in favor of more adaptive frameworks that promote resilience and comprehensive risk management. Future studies are expected to further challenge and redefine core emergency management principles, including the All Hazards Approach, All Agencies Approach, and Prepared Community strategies.",NO
Along adjustment path.docx,Sustainable Finance and Economic Trends,"Economic growth across the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) regions displayed a mixed pattern, driven by fluctuations in global energy prices, geopolitical tensions, and structural changes in key sectors. After declining to 2.6% in 2023, growth in the EBRD regions rebounded to an estimated 2.9% in early 2024 due to stabilizing energy prices and gradual recovery from reduced Russian gas imports. Growth forecasts have been revised downward for 2024 to 2.8% and for 2025 to 3.5% due to weaker prospects in advanced Europe, mining stagnation in Central Asia, and ongoing conflicts and climate disruptions in the Mediterranean region.

Gas and oil prices have normalized near their 2017-2021 levels, though import dynamics have shifted, with many economies transitioning from Russian supplies to alternative sources like Norwegian gas and LNG imports from the United States. Inflation in the region has steadily declined, reaching 5.8% by mid-2024, with a parallel increase in real wages that has boosted consumption but may plateau as wage growth moderates. Governments and corporations experienced temporary relief from debt burdens due to high inflation, though rising interest rates and fiscal deficits pose ongoing risks, particularly in economies like Greece, Ukraine, and Tunisia.

Disparities in growth trends remain, with Central Asia and Eastern Europe maintaining robust growth driven by industrial production and infrastructure investment, while economies in Central Europe, Baltic states, and Southern Mediterranean face more subdued recovery. Central Asian economies like Uzbekistan continue to struggle with energy supply issues despite ongoing reforms and infrastructure investments, while Mongolia and Kazakhstan face vulnerabilities related to weather events and commodity exports.

Greenfield Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) patterns reveal shifts towards energy transition sectors, with economies like Hungary benefiting from large-scale Chinese investments in battery production. Conversely, Russia's FDI inflows collapsed following its invasion of Ukraine, prompting trade realignments towards non-sanctioning economies such as China and Turkey. Declining intergenerational mobility and persistent fiscal vulnerabilities highlight long-term challenges in achieving equitable and resilient growth across the region.

The trajectory of growth will depend heavily on geopolitical stability, inflationary pressures, climate impacts, and global demand, particularly from key partners like China and the European Union. Investment in infrastructure, energy diversification, and risk management frameworks will be crucial to mitigating these risks and sustaining recovery in the medium term.",NO

financing_change_how_to_mobilize_private-sector_financing_for_sustainable-_infrastructure.docx,Sustainable Finance and Economic Trends," This report by the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment, titled ""Financing Change: How to Mobilize Private-Sector Financing for Sustainable Infrastructure,"" highlights the crucial need for increased investment in sustainable infrastructure to meet global climate goals and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Infrastructure investment, particularly in developing and middle-income countries, needs to rise significantly, with an estimated $6 trillion per year required through 2030. Currently, annual infrastructure spending stands at only $3 trillion, with private-sector contributions making up roughly half of that amount.

The report underscores the importance of sustainable infrastructure, which is defined as socially inclusive, economically viable, and environmentally friendly. Such infrastructure is vital for mitigating climate risk, promoting economic growth, and reducing inequality. However, mobilizing private capital faces significant barriers, including:

Lack of transparent, bankable project pipelines.
High development and transaction costs, particularly for small-scale projects.
Absence of viable funding models in sectors like water and sanitation.
Perceived risks requiring high returns from investors.
Regulatory and policy uncertainties.
Strategies to overcome these challenges include enhancing project preparation, using development capital to offset sustainability premiums, leveraging development bank guarantees, improving procurement processes, and promoting financial instruments such as green bonds and sustainability-focused investment vehicles.

The report emphasizes that fostering a supportive enabling environment—with sound policies, reliable institutions, and consistent regulatory frameworks—will be critical to scaling up private-sector investment. Development banks and public finance institutions are encouraged to play a catalytic role by offering risk-sharing mechanisms and blending public and private capital.

Sustainable infrastructure is central to a low-carbon development model, with key investments needed in power, transportation, telecommunications, and water systems. The report concludes that increasing both the quantity and quality of financing for sustainable infrastructure can yield a ""triple win"" by driving economic development, reducing emissions, and delivering strong financial returns for investors.",YES
